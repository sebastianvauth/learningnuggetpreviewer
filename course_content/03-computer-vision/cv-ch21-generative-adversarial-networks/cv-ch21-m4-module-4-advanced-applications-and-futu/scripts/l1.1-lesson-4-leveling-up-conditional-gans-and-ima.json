It's like having a magical painting machine that only has a 'surprise me' button. What if we want to be more specific? What if we want to ask for a '7', or turn a boring map into a satellite photo, or transform a summer scene into a winter wonderland? It's time to give our Generator some directions."

This vector is shown being fed, alongside random noise, into the 'Generator' block.\n- The same '7' vector is also shown being fed into the 'Discriminator' block.\n- The Generator's output grid updates to show a variety of newly generated images, all of which are variations of the digit '7'.

The original horse and the reconstructed horse are shown side-by-side with a red arrow between them labeled 'Cycle-Consistency Loss'. The caption reads: 'The reconstructed horse should look identical to the original!'\n4.
