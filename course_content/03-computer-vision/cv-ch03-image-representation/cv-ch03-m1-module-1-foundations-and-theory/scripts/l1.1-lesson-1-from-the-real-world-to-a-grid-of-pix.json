It then moves through a stylized 'funnel' labeled 'Abstraction' which lists 'Spatial Discretization', 'Intensity Discretization', and 'Projection'. The apple emerges on the other side as a clearly pixelated version of itself, made of colored squares. This visually summarizes the entire abstraction process from continuous reality to a discrete digital image."

          "text": "Have you ever zoomed *way* into a digital photo and seen it break down into a bunch of tiny squares? It's a bit like looking at a mosaic up close. What's actually going on there? It turns out that a digital image isn't a perfect, continuous copy of reality. Instead, it's a very clever and very detailed approximation. In this lesson, we'll peel back the layers and discover the first fundamental step in creating a digital image: turning the smooth, continuous world into a structured grid of pixels."

As the student drags the slider to the right, the image zooms in on the deer's eye. At first, the zoom is smooth. After about 50% on the slider, the image starts to show its pixelated nature, with smooth curves becoming jagged 'staircases'. When the slider is at 100%, the view is a grid of 10x10 solid-colored squares. Hovering the mouse over any square will cause it to be outlined in white, and a small tooltip appears showing its grid coordinates, like '(x: 152, y: 88)' and its RGB color value. This makes the abstract concept of a pixel grid tangible and interactive."
