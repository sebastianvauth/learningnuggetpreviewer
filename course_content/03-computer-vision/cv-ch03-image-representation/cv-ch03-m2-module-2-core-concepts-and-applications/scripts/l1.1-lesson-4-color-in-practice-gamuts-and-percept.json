Then, a semi-transparent, triangular cookie-cutter shape labeled 'sRGB Monitor' is overlaid on top, cutting out only a portion of the colors. The animation makes it clear that the device can only 'capture' a subset of the total available colors. This visually introduces the concept of a limited gamut."

          "text": "So, we have this beautiful, all-encompassing map of human vision—the CIE Chromaticity Diagram. It's our universal dictionary for color. Now for the reality check: your screen can't actually show you all those colors. Neither can a printer, or your phone, or a movie projector. Every device has its limits. In this lesson, we'll explore these practical limitations, called 'gamuts,' and discover another, more intuitive way to think about color differences."

On the right, there are three checkboxes: '[ ] sRGB (Web & Monitors)', '[ ] Adobe RGB (Pro Photography)', and '[ ] CMYK (Standard Print)'. When the student checks 'sRGB', a triangle appears on the diagram, covering a significant but limited portion of the green and red areas (like in Figure 3.8). Checking 'Adobe RGB' adds a second, slightly larger triangle that extends further into the greens. Checking 'CMYK' adds a third, irregular, smaller shape, showing the even more limited range of a typical printer. Students can toggle them on and off to directly see how the gamuts compare to each other and to the full space of human vision."

And see how much smaller the printer's gamut is? This is why a photo can look vibrant on your screen but dull when you print it out—some of the on-screen colors simply don't exist in the printer's 'vocabulary'.",

If you're a web designer, you design within the sRGB gamut because you know that's what most of your users will see. If you're a photographer shooting for a magazine, you might work in a wider gamut like Adobe RGB to preserve as much color information as possible before converting it to the printer's specific CMYK gamut. Understanding gamuts is the key to managing color consistency across different media."

Another line appears between them, also labeled 'Distance = 1 unit'. A caption appears below: 'In CIE XYZ space, these two pairs are an equal 'distance' apart... but which difference looks bigger to YOUR eyes?' The difference between the blue and yellow is obviously much more dramatic, visually demonstrating the non-uniformity."

Instead of thinking in terms of Red, Green, and Blue light mixtures, HSV/HSL lets you think in terms of: **H**ue (the type of color, like 'red' or 'green'), **S**aturation (the intensity or purity of the color, from gray to vibrant), and **V**alue/**L**ightness (the brightness of the color). It's much easier for us to say 'I want a slightly less saturated blue' than to figure out the right R, G, and B numbers to achieve that."

              "question": "So if I want the best colors, should I just buy a monitor with the widest possible gamut?",
              "answer": "Yes, but with a big 'if'! A wide-gamut monitor (like one that covers Adobe RGB) can display more colors, which is great for photo and video editing. *However*, if you're viewing regular web content (which is all designed for sRGB), a wide-gamut monitor might actually make the colors look *wrong*—oversaturated and cartoonish—unless it has proper color management to display sRGB content correctly. It's a powerful tool, but it needs to be used correctly!"
