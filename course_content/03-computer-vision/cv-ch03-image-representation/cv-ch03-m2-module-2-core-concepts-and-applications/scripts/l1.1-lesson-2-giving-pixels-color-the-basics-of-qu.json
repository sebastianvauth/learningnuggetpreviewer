A beam of light hits it, and then it goes through a box labeled 'ADC' (Analog-to-Digital Converter). It emerges on the other side as a set of three numbers: (R: 217, G: 45, B: 88). These numbers then fill the pixel with a specific shade of red. This visualizes the core concept of the lesson: converting light into numbers to create color."

How does a camera translate the infinite shades of a sunset into something it can store in a file? It's not magic, it's math! In this lesson, we're going to dive into how continuous, real-world light is converted into concrete numbers, and how we use those numbers to construct every color you see on your screen."

Sliders for Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow start at 0. As the student drags the 'Cyan' slider, cyan 'ink' covers the circle, absorbing light. If they add yellow, it mixes to become green.

Most consumer cameras actually have a single sensor, but they use a clever trick called a 'Bayer Filter'—a mosaic of tiny red, green, and blue filters placed over the individual light sensors—to capture color information. We'll explore exactly how that works later on!"
