On the far right, it shows a futuristic, glowing brain with inputs like 'text prompt' and 'mouse click' pointing to it, which then outputs a perfect segmentation mask. This visualizes the evolution from specialized, hand-crafted models to general-purpose, promptable AI."

But the field of AI is moving at lightning speed. What does the cutting edge look like *now*? In this final lesson, we're going to explore the future. We'll see a world of hybrid architectures that merge the best of CNNs and Transformers, automated tools that build a perfect model for you, and massive, general-purpose 'foundation models' that you can literally just talk to."

We also know that Transformers, which took the world of Natural Language Processing by storm, are masters at understanding long-range relationships and global context. So, an obvious question arose: what if we could get the best of both worlds?",

A text label appears: 'U-Net's proven structure + Transformer's global context = A powerful hybrid!'"

They take the proven and effective encoder-decoder structure of a U-Net, complete with its vital skip connections for preserving high-resolution details, but they replace the standard convolutional blocks in the encoder with powerful Swin Transformer blocks. This creates a model that has the inherent spatial bias of a U-Net but is supercharged with the Transformer's ability to model dependencies across the entire image.",

SAM is an incredible generalist, perfect for a huge range of tasks where you don't have labeled data. But if you are a hospital with thousands of labeled cardiac MRI scans and you need the absolute highest possible accuracy for that one specific task, a specialist model (like one from nnU-Net) fine-tuned on that exact data can still often outperform the generalist.
