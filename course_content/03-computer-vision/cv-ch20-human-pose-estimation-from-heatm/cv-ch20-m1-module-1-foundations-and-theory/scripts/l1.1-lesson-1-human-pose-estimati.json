Clicking the 'MPII Schema' button switches the overlay to a 16-point skeleton, and the text changes to: 'The MPII schema uses 16 keypoints with a focus on major limb joints, popular for action recognition tasks.' This allows students to visually compare the two popular schemas and understand their differences."

A text overlay reads: 'Step 1: Detect Persons. Step 2: Estimate Pose per Person. Pro: High accuracy per person. Con: Slows down with more people.' When the student switches to 'Bottom-Up', the animation changes. First, all the 'elbow' keypoints in the entire image light up, then all the 'knees', and so on for every joint type. After all joints are found, colored lines animate to connect the dots into individual skeletons. The text overlay now reads: 'Step 1: Detect all Joints. Step 2: Associate joints into Skeletons. Pro: Very fast, runtime is independent of crowd size. Con: Association can be very tricky!'"

The trade-off is complexity; correctly associating dozens of detected elbows and knees into the correct skeletons is a very difficult engineering challenge. A Top-Down approach would be too slow, as it would need to run its pose estimator on every single person it detects in the crowd."
