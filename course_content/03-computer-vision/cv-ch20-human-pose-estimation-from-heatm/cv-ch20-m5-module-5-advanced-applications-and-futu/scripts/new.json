An arrow shows both the original 'RGB Image' AND the new '2D Pose' flowing into a second box labeled '[Segmentation Model]', which outputs a 'Body Part Mask' (a colored-in silhouette).\n3. Finally, all three—Image, Pose, and Mask—flow into a third box labeled '[Volume Model]', which outputs the final 'Body Part Volume' estimates.\nThis animation clearly shows how the information from the previous step enriches the input for the next."
