Below it is a slider. As the student drags the slider, a vertical cursor moves across the spectrum. Three boxes update in real-time:\n1. 'Wave Type': Displays the name (e.g., 'Ultraviolet').\n2. 'Energy Level': A vertical bar graph that fills up to show high energy for gamma rays and low energy for radio waves.\n3.
