How do we see millions of colors when we only have a few types of color sensors? And how does the raw data from the eye become the rich, 3D world we experience? Let's follow the signal."

A single color of light, like yellow, will stimulate multiple cone types at once—in this case, both the green and red cones will fire strongly. The brain perceives 'yellow' not from a 'yellow sensor', but by comparing the *relative strength* of the signals from the green and red cones. It's a brilliant and efficient system!",

Below the graph is a color wheel or slider. As the student selects a color (e.g., drags the slider to 'yellow'), an animation shows a beam of that color light hitting the cones on the graph. Simultaneously, three 'Signal Strength' bars labeled 'S', 'M', and 'L' update in real-time. For yellow, the M and L bars would be nearly full, while the S bar would be very low.",

The **Ventral Stream** figures out *what* you're seeing, while the **Dorsal Stream** figures out *where* it is and *how* to interact with it.\n\nNow that we have a solid grasp of the biological gold standard, it's time to turn our attention to how we've tried to replicate this miracle in machines.
