            {
              "text": "Next, the light hits the lens. Just like in a camera, the lens's job is to focus the light. It bends the light rays so they converge perfectly on the retina at the back of the eye. Your eye can even change the shape of its lens to focus on things that are near or far!",
              "interactive": "Description for 'Explore the Eye': The screen displays a detailed, labeled cross-section of the human eye (based on Figure 2.4). Key parts like 'Pupil', 'Iris', 'Lens', 'Retina', and 'Optic Nerve' are clickable. When a student clicks on a label, a pop-up appears with a concise, easy-to-understand description of its function. For example, clicking 'Lens' would show: 'This flexible structure focuses incoming light onto the retina, changing its shape to focus on objects at different distances.'",

                "answer": "That's the switch from Cone-vision to Rod-vision! Your cones, which were active in the bright light, are not sensitive enough for the dark room. It takes a few minutes for your rods to become fully active and for your pupils to open wide. This process is called 'dark adaptation'."

Let's recap what we learned:\n\n- **Path of Light:** Light enters the **pupil**, is focused by the **lens**, and forms an image on the **retina**.\n- **The Retina's Duo:** The retina uses two types of photoreceptors to convert light to signals.\n- **Rods:** The heroes of the night. They provide highly sensitive, low-resolution, black-and-white vision.\n- **Cones:** The masters of the day. They give us sharp, high-resolution, color vision but need bright light.\n\nSo we have a signal... but how does the brain make sense of it? In the next lesson, we'll follow that signal into the brain to see how we perceive color and the world around us."
