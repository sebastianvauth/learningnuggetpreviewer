A large aperture is less strict, and only the exact distance you're focused on will be perfectly sharp. Let's see this in action.",

A slider is labeled 'Aperture' with settings from 'f/1.8 (Large Opening)' to 'f/22 (Small Opening)'.\n- As the student moves the slider towards 'f/1.8', the flower stays sharp, but the tree and mountains become very blurry. A 'light meter' shows the scene is bright. A text label says 'Shallow Depth of Field - great for portraits!'.\n- As they move the slider towards 'f/22', the flower, tree, and mountains all become sharp. The light meter shows the scene is much darker. A label says 'Deep Depth of Field - great for landscapes!'.",

Its geometry is described by the **projection equations**.\n- **The Role of a Lens:** Lenses solve the pinhole's brightness vs. sharpness trade-off, allowing for images that are both bright and sharp.\n- **Aperture & DoF:** The aperture controls both the amount of light and the **Depth of Field**, giving photographers and roboticists control over what is in focus.\n\nWe've successfully formed a sharp, bright image on a plane. But how do we *record* it and turn it into a digital file? In the next lesson, we'll dive into the heart of the digital camera: the sensor."
