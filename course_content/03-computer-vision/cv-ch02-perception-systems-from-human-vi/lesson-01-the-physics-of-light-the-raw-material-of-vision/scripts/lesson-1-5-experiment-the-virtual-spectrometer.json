On the other side, it exits as a fanned-out rainbow (Spectrum), clearly showing Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet bands on a screen.",
          "textAfterInteractive": "Notice how the single white beam was hiding all these colors inside it? The prism separates them because different wavelengths bend (refract) at slightly different angles. Blue bends more than Red.",

            "revealText": "No! A laser is monochromatic (one color). The prism would bend the green beam, but since there are no other wavelengths to separate out, it would just remain a single green beam. You can't split what isn't mixed."
