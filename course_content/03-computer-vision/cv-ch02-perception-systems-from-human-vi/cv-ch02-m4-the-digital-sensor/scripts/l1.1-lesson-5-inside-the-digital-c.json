Below are draggable tiles with 'R', 'G', and 'B' on them. The instruction is: 'The sensor is colorblind. Drag the filters onto the grid to create the Bayer Pattern and give it color vision!' The grid only accepts the correct RGGB pattern. When the student completes a 2x2 block correctly, it snaps into place. Once the full 4x4 grid is filled, a message appears: 'Success! Notice there are twice as many green filters? That's because our eyes are most sensitive to green, and this pattern mimics that!'",

They are cheaper to make, use less power, and are fast enough for high-frame-rate video. This is the technology inside your smartphone, webcam, and most consumer cameras today.",

CCDs are slow and high-quality, while CMOS sensors are fast, cheap, and dominate the modern market.\n\nBut the speed of a CMOS sensor comes with a strange side effect that can warp reality.
