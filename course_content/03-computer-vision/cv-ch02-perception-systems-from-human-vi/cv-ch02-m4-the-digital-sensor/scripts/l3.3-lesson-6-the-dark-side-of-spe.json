          "text": "In the last lesson, we learned that CMOS sensors are fast because they read data from the sensor row by row. But this speed comes at a price. This row-by-row readout doesn't capture a single, perfect instant in time. Instead, it captures a 'rolling' snapshot of reality, which can lead to some very strange and very weird visual artifacts."

When the user clicks a 'Capture' button, all pixels in the grid flash white simultaneously. On the right, a grid is labeled 'Rolling Shutter'. When the user clicks 'Capture', a white 'scan line' rapidly moves down the grid from top to bottom. A running timer shows that the bottom row is 'captured' a few milliseconds after the top row.",

In some cases, these artifacts must be corrected with software before the video can be used for reliable analysis."

                "answer": "Cost and complexity! Implementing a global shutter on a CMOS sensor requires adding extra circuitry to each and every pixel to store the charge temporarily. This makes the sensor more complex, more expensive to manufacture, and can sometimes slightly reduce its light-gathering ability. For most consumer uses, the benefits of a cheaper, simpler rolling shutter design outweigh the occasional artifacts."

Let's recap:\n\n- **Global Shutter (CCD):** Captures a single, perfect instant in time across the entire frame. No distortion.\n- **Rolling Shutter (CMOS):** Captures the frame row by row in a rapid sequence. It's fast and efficient.\n- **The Artifacts:** This row-by-row capture can cause fast-moving objects or fast camera pans to appear skewed, bent, or wobbly.\n\nNow that we understand the full process of capturing light—from the lens, to the sensor, to the readout—we are ready for the final step. How does this raw electronic data become the final, colorful image file we all know and use? Let's find out."
