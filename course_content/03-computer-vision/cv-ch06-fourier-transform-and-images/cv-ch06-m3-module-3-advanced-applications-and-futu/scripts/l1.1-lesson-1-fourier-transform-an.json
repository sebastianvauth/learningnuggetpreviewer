But this aggressive, lossy process isn't without its consequences. Like footprints at a crime scene, compression leaves behind evidence. In this final lesson, we'll become digital detectives, learn to spot the tell-tale signs of compression—called **artifacts**—and then zoom out to see the entire image generation process from start to finish."

As the student drags the slider to the left, the image on the screen is re-rendered in real-time to simulate the chosen JPEG quality level. \n- At a setting of 50, the image looks mostly fine.\n- At 20, subtle blurring and ringing artifacts begin to appear, and callout boxes pop up pointing to them.\n- At 5, the image is a mess of artifacts. Callout boxes clearly point to 'Blocking' in a smooth area, 'Ringing' around a sharp edge, and 'Blurring' on a textured surface."

Our job for the rest of this course is to learn how to take this final, highly-processed numerical data and *decode its meaning*—to analyze these numbers and their relationships to understand the original scene and identify objects like apples or cats. We must always remember that we can only recover information that was actually encoded and preserved through this complex process."

The key takeaways are:\n- Lossy compression can introduce visual errors called **artifacts**, most commonly **blocking**, **ringing**, and **blurring**.\n- The complete image generation process is a multi-step pipeline that transforms real-world light into a highly processed and compressed digital file.\n- The fundamental task of computer vision is to analyze this final numerical data to extract meaningful, semantic understanding about the original scene.\n\nYou now have a deep appreciation for what an image file truly is. You're ready to move on to the next major part of our course: learning the techniques to manipulate and extract information from these digital images."
