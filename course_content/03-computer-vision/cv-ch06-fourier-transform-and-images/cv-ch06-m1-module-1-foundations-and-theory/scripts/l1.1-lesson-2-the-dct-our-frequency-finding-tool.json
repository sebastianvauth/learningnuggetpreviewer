A large 8x8 grid displays the 64 DCT basis functions. \n- **On Hover:** When a student's cursor moves over any of the 64 patterns, a tooltip appears with its coordinates and a description. For example, hovering over the pattern at (u=3, v=0) would show a tooltip: 'Horizontal Frequency: 3, Vertical Frequency: 0. This pattern represents smooth vertical stripes.'\n- **On Click:** Clicking on a basis function enlarges it in a pop-up window with a more detailed explanation. For the top-left (0,0) block: 'This is the DC Component! It has zero frequency and represents the average brightness of the entire 8x8 pixel block. It's the most important one!'.

Smaller blocks (like 4x4) don't offer enough different frequency patterns to be good at compression. Larger blocks (like 16x16) are much more computationally expensive and are less able to adapt to small, local details in an image. 8x8 hit the sweet spot for the technology when JPEG was designed, and it has stuck around ever since!"

In the next lesson, we'll become frequency hackers and learn how to manipulate these components to filter our images in powerful ways."
