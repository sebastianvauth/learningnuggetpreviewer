If you've ever sent a photo, browsed a website, or used social media, you've used JPEG. It is, without a doubt, the workhorse of the digital image world. But its incredible success is built on a surprising secret: it works by throwing away information on purpose!"

The key takeaways are:\n- **Lossless** compression (like PNG) is perfectly reversible but offers modest size reduction. **Lossy** compression (like JPEG) achieves massive size reduction by permanently discarding data.\n- The JPEG pipeline begins by exploiting human vision. It transforms the image to **YCbCr** to separate brightness from color.\n- It then performs **Chroma Subsampling**, aggressively reducing the amount of color data, which our eyes are less sensitive to.\n- Finally, it splits the image into **8x8 blocks** to prepare for the frequency analysis we learned about.\n\nWe've set the stage. In our next lesson, we will see how the DCT is applied to these blocks and witness the most critical, data-destroying step of them all: Quantization."
