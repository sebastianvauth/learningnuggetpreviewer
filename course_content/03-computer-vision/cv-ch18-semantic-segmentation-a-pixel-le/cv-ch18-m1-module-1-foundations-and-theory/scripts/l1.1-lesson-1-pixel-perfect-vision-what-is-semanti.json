'Object Detection' draws bounding boxes around cars and people. 'Semantic Segmentation' transforms the image into the colorful, pixel-perfect segmentation mask, with a legend (e.g., blue=road, red=car, green=tree). This provides a powerful, direct comparison of the tasks' granularity."

It's a key distinction. **Semantic segmentation**, which we're learning now, labels pixels with their class (e.g., all objects identified as 'car' are colored red). **Instance segmentation** goes a step further and distinguishes between different *instances* of the same class (e.g., car-1 is red, car-2 is pink, car-3 is orange). We're focusing on semantic segmentation first as it's the foundational task that leads to instance segmentation."
