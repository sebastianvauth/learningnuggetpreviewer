The brain is a master of efficiency, which means it loves to take shortcuts based on past experience. But sometimes, those shortcuts lead it down the wrong path, creating fascinating errors we call **optical illusions**. In this lesson, we'll see how your brain can be beautifully tricked by one of the most powerful tools it uses: **context**."

Two squares, one in direct light (A) and one in the shadow of a green cylinder (B), are clearly marked.\n\n- **Phase 1 (Initial View):** The user sees the full illusion. The question 'Which square is darker, A or B?' is posed. Most users will perceive A as much darker.\n\n- **Phase 2 (The Proof):** A button appears labeled 'Grab the Color'. When clicked, a virtual eyedropper tool appears. The user can drag it over square A. A box next to the cursor displays its color value (e.g., 'Grayscale: 120'). The user is then prompted to drag the eyedropper over square B. As they do, the box shows the *exact same value*: 'Grayscale: 120'.\n\n- **Phase 3 (The Reveal):** A final button appears: 'Remove Context'. When clicked, an animation plays where the rest of the checkerboard and the cylinder fade to a neutral gray, leaving only squares A and B floating side-by-side. Now, stripped of their context, they are revealed to be identical shades of gray."

So, it automatically 'corrects' your perception, making you see square B as a much lighter gray than it actually is. This powerful mechanism is called **lightness constancy**.",

Our perception is never just about the object itself, but about the object in relation to its entire environment.\n\nNext, we'll dive even deeper into the brain's bag of tricks and see how it can invent motion and color that aren't even there."
