On the right, a camera lens is looking at the same apple, but the output is a grid of RGB numerical values (e.g., [210, 25, 10]). This starkly contrasts the two modes of 'seeing'."

Below it is a slider, positioned all the way to the left under a label that reads 'Human Perception (Semantic)'.\n\n- **Interaction:** The student can drag the slider to the right. As they do, two things happen simultaneously:\n  1. The image of the apple becomes progressively more pixelated, its smooth curves turning into blocky squares of color.\n  2. The label below the slider changes, moving from 'Semantic' to 'Abstract' to 'Numerical'.\n\n- **Final State:** When the slider reaches the far right, the image has transformed completely into a grid of colored squares. Hovering over any square reveals its raw RGB numerical value in a tooltip, for example: `RGB(210, 25, 10)`. The label now reads 'Computer Data (Numerical)'."

A texture is a repeating pattern. An object is a large-scale pattern of lines and textures. Computer vision algorithms are, at their core, sophisticated pattern detectors."

            "answer": "That's a fantastic philosophical question! Initially, human vision is our inspiration and benchmark. But ultimately, the goal is often to create systems that are *better* than humans for specific tasks—more consistent, not prone to illusions, and able to see in ways we can't (like in infrared or ultraviolet). We learn from human vision, but we don't necessarily want to copy its flaws."

In the next chapter, we'll take our first concrete step by exploring exactly how a camera turns light into the numbers we've been talking about."
