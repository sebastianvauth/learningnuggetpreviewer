          "text": "So far, we've seen how our brain can misinterpret static scenes. But it gets even weirder. Sometimes, your brain doesn't just misinterpret what's there; it actively creates perceptions of motion and color that don't exist in the real world at all! In this lesson, we're going to explore the ghosts in our visual machine and witness how our brain invents reality."

However, its shadow on the floor moves horizontally back and forth. This makes the ball appear to be bouncing and rolling across the court.\n- **Part 2 (5 seconds):** The ball continues to bounce with the exact same vertical motion, but now the shadow stays directly underneath it, simply growing and shrinking. The ball now appears to be bouncing straight up and down in one spot."

            "description": "An interactive animation of the 'Lilac Chaser' illusion (Figure 1.8) is displayed against a neutral gray background. A small black cross is fixed in the center.\n\n- **Phase 1 (Instructions):** Text appears: 'Stare directly at the black cross in the center. Do not move your eyes for at least 30 seconds. Relax and let your eyes adjust.'\n\n- **Phase 2 (The Illusion):** A circle of 12 magenta dots appears. One by one, each dot disappears for a fraction of a second, creating a rotating gap. This loop continues.\n\n- **Phase 3 (The Effect):** After about 15-20 seconds of staring, two things will happen for the user: \n  1. First, they will likely perceive a phantom green dot moving around the circle, occupying the space of the disappearing magenta dot. \n  2. If they continue to stare, the stationary magenta dots may fade away completely due to neural fatigue, leaving only the moving green dot visible.\n\n- **Phase 4 (The Explanation):** After 30 seconds, the animation stops and two clickable buttons appear: 'Why do I see GREEN?' and 'Why does it MOVE?'\n  - **Clicking 'Why GREEN?':** A pop-up appears showing a simple color wheel. Magenta and green are on opposite sides, highlighted. The text explains: 'This is a **Negative Afterimage**. When the retinal cells that detect magenta get tired from staring, their 'opposite' cells (green) become more active. When the magenta dot disappears, you see the rebound effect as a green ghost.'\n  - **Clicking 'Why does it MOVE?':** A pop-up explains: 'This is **Apparent Motion**. Your brain's motion detectors don't see a series of green afterimages appearing and disappearing; they interpret the sequential stimulation as a single object moving smoothly from one spot to the next.'"

            "answer": "Your central vision (the fovea) is packed with cone cells, which are great for seeing fine detail and color. Your peripheral vision has more rod cells, which are less detailed but extremely sensitive to light and motion. This makes your periphery a great 'early warning system' for detecting movement, even if it can't make out the details—which also makes it more susceptible to motion illusions!"

          "text": "Today, we ventured into the mind's ability to create phantoms. We learned that:\n- Our brain uses cues like **shadows and shading** to construct a perception of 3D motion, even from a static image.\n- We can experience **apparent motion** in our periphery, where our motion-sensitive cells misinterpret patterns.\n- We can see colors that aren't there through **negative afterimages**, a direct result of neural fatigue and rebound.\n\nWe've seen how our brain can misinterpret things and even invent things. But what about when it misses things that are right in front of us? In the next lesson, we'll explore the role of attention and the stunning phenomenon of 'change blindness'."
