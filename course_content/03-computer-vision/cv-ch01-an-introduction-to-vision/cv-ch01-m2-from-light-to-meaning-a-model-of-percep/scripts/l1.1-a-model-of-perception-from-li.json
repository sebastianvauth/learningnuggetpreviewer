We can simplify this incredible process into a simple, three-step model."

It's the total reality that exists around us.'\n- **On Click [Filter (The Senses)]:** A pop-up appears with the text: 'Your sensory organs, like the eye, act as filters.

For vision, this is reflected light—pure, objective data.'\n- **On Click [Model (The Brain)]:** A pop-up appears with the text: 'Your brain receives the filtered data and gets to work. It processes these patterns to construct a subjective interpretation, or a symbolic model, of what it's sensing (e.g., the concept of 'apple').'"

In the next lesson, we'll have some fun exploring optical illusions to see what happens when the brain's interpretation process goes wonderfully wrong."
