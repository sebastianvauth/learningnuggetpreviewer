The Right Panel shows its 2D frequency spectrum, visualized with the low frequencies at the center and high frequencies at the edges. Students are given a 'magic brush' tool. They can 'paint' over the frequency spectrum to erase parts of it. As they paint, the image in the left panel updates in real-time. If they erase the center (low frequencies), only the edges will remain in the image. If they erase the outer edges (high frequencies), the image will become blurry.

This knowledge will serve you well as we move on to explore specific applications like image compression in the chapters to come.",
          "frequentlyAsked": {
            "question": "Why is the frequency spectrum always shown with the low frequencies in the center?",
            "answer": "That's an excellent observation! The raw output of an FFT algorithm usually places the zero-frequency (DC) component at the corner (the 0,0 coordinate). However, for visualization, this is inconvenient. The spectrum is symmetric, so shifting the DC component to the center makes it much easier for us humans to see the patterns and understand the distribution of low and high frequencies. It's purely a display convention to aid our understanding."
