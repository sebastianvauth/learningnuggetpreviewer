If someone hands you a messy, complex signal, how do you figure out its secret recipe? How do you measure *how much* of a specific frequency is hiding in there?"

If you bring it near a piano string that is also tuned to 'A' and playing, your tuning fork will start to vibrate strongly in sympathy. This is called resonance. If you bring it near a 'C' string, however, it will barely react.",

Top Plot: A fixed 'Target Signal' is shown (e.g., a signal made of a 1 Hz sine wave and a 3 Hz sine wave). Middle Plot: A 'Test Wave' is shown. Students can control its 'Frequency' and 'Phase' with sliders. Bottom Plot: This shows the real-time point-wise product of the top two waves. The areas above and below zero are shaded in green and red, respectively. The 'Correlation Score' box displays the integral of this bottom plot. As students drag the frequency slider, they will see the Score spike to a large positive value when the slider hits '1 Hz' and '3 Hz' (if the phase is also correct). They can then adjust the phase slider to see how the score drops to zero, discovering the four cases for themselves."

We don't need magic to find the frequency recipe; we just need a good test.\n- We learned we can **correlate** a signal with a test wave by multiplying them and integrating the result.\n- A large positive result means we found a frequency component that matches in both **frequency and phase**.\n- A result near zero means there's a mismatch in either frequency or phase (or both).\n\nWe've hit a small roadblock, though: testing for both frequency and phase separately seems clumsy. In the next lesson, we'll introduce a powerful mathematical tool—complex numbers—that will let us test for both at the same time, elegantly and efficiently.",

Is the product *mostly* positive, indicating a match? Or do the positive and negative parts cancel out? Integration is the mathematical tool that gives us this single, definitive 'overall score' by finding the net area under the product curve."
