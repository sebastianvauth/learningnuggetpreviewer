As the student adjusts the sliders, a new wave representing the sum of the selected harmonics is overlaid on the target wave. Simultaneously, a bar chart to the right (the frequency spectrum) updates in real-time to show the 'recipe'. A button 'Auto-build' animates the process of adding the harmonics one by one in the correct proportions, showing the approximation improve with each step."

By simplifying the recipe, it drastically reduces the file size. We're moving from describing *what* the signal is at every single point in time to describing its more fundamental *ingredients*."
