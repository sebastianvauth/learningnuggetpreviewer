That tool exists, and it's one of the most beautiful and powerful concepts in all of mathematics: **complex numbers**."

In physics and engineering, the imaginary unit 'j' is best thought of not as a quantity, but as a *rotator*. Multiplying a number by 'j' is equivalent to rotating it 90 degrees counter-clockwise on the complex plane. It's a mathematical operator that helps us elegantly manage two related quantities (like sine and cosine, or the x and y components of a wave) within a single number."
