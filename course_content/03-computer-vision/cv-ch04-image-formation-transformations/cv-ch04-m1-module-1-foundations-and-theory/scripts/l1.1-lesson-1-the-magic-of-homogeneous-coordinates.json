But what if I told you there's a secret language that lets us do both—and even more—with a single, elegant tool? In this lesson, we'll learn this mathematical 'hack' called homogeneous coordinates. It’s the key that unlocks the geometry of computer vision."

A user can click and drag a point `P = (x, y)` on the 2D grid. As they do, two things happen in the 3D panel: 1) A bright ray is drawn from the origin (0,0,0) passing through the point `(x, y, 1)`. 2) Several points along this ray are highlighted, each with their coordinates displayed (e.g., `(x,y,1)`, `(2x, 2y, 2)`, `(0.5x, 0.5y, 0.5)`). A text box below the 3D panel shows the back-projection calculation for a selected point on the ray, always resulting in the original `(x, y)`. This interaction solidifies the concept that a 2D point corresponds to an entire ray in homogeneous space."
