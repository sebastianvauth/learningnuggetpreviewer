We\u0027ll travel back to 2012 to dissect the AlexNet model, a deep neural network that shattered all previous records in image recognition and single-handedly launched the modern deep learning era. Through a mix of theory, hands-on experiments, and coding exercises, you will understand not just how this model worked, but why it changed the world.",

We will also explore what AlexNet actually learned and why it remains so important today through Transfer Learning.",

Finally, we\u0027ll see how this new paradigm challenges the reign of convolutions in computer vision.",

We will dissect the ingenious adversarial framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), learning how two competing networks can be trained to generate stunningly realistic images from nothing but random noise. We\u0027ll explore the theory, master the training, and discover the common pitfalls and advanced techniques that revolutionized generative AI.",
